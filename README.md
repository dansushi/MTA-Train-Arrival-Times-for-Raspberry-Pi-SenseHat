# NYC MTA Subway Live Train Arrival Time Display for the Raspberry Pi's SenseHat

In order for this to work, you must also be running MTAPI from Jon Thornton:
https://github.com/jonthornton/MTAPI

This python file is set by default to the Parkside Av station and you can arrow arroudn to other nearby stations (As well as Times Square). If you want to run for stations nearby you, you must custom edit this script with the station IDs given by MTAPI. Also, you must adjust the custom_led_displays.py to show the visual representation for the stations on the SenseHat.
